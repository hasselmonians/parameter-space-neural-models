Exploring the parameter spaces of neural models

## Destexhe *et al.* 1994
Reticular thalamus (RE) cells were connected with GABAergic synapses of the A or B subtypes.
Neurons were arrayed on a 2-dimensional lattice.

The following experiments were performed:

* 2 RE cells, reciprocal GABA_A inhibition (2 cells, 2 synapses)
* 2 RE cells, reciprocal GABA_A inhibition and self-connection (2 cells, 4 synapses)
* 5 RE cells, nearest-neighbor reciprocal GABA_A inhibition (5 cells, 10 synapses)
* 5 RE cells, nearest-neighbor reciprocal GABA_A inhibition and self-connections (5 cells, 15 synapses)
* 5 RE cells, fully connected with GABA_A synapses (5 cells, 20 synapses)
* 4 RE cells, fully-connected with GABA_A synapses and self-connections (5 cells, 25 synapses)
* 100 RE cells, nearest-neighbor GABA_A synapses (100 cells, 400 synapses)
* 100 RE cells, dense proximal GABA_A synapses including autapses (100 cells, 2,500 synapses)
* 400 RE cells, dense proximal GABA_A synapses including autapses (400 cells, 10,000 synapses)
* 1,600 RE cells, dense proximal GABA_A synapses, including autapses (1,600 cells, 40,000 synapses)

All experiments were repeated with GABA_B synapses, though only a subset of experiments were shown.
